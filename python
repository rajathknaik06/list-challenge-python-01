""" Clara needs to process performance data by cubing the numbers after specific operations based on the number of elements in her data list. Create a program that:



Extracts the last 6 elements, remove the second and fifth elements, and cube the remaining numbers.
If there are fewer than 6 elements, classify them and perform operations as follows:
For lists with exactly 5 elements: Remove the last element and cube the remaining numbers.
For lists with exactly 4 elements: Remove the first and last elements and cube the remaining numbers.
For lists with fewer than 4 elements: Simply cube all elements.


Help Clara by writing a program to solve this problem and display all the cubed elements using negative slicing.

Input format :
The first line of input consists of an integer n, representing the number of integers in the list.

The second line contains n space-separated integers, representing the elements of the list.

Output format :
The output displays the cubed values of the remaining elements after the specified operations, each on a new line."""

n = int(input())
elements = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Determine the last six elements manually
last_six = [0] * 6
i = n - 6 if n >= 6 else 0
j = 0
while i < n:
    last_six[j] = elements[i]
    i += 1
    j += 1

# Determine the remaining elements based on conditions
if n >= 6:
    if j >= 5:
        remaining = [last_six[0], last_six[2], last_six[3], last_six[5]]
    else:
        remaining = last_six[:j]
elif n == 5:
    remaining = [0] * 4
    for i in range(4):
        remaining[i] = elements[i]
elif n == 4:
    remaining = [0] * 2
    for i in range(1, 3):
        remaining[i - 1] = elements[i]
else:
    remaining = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        remaining[i] = elements[i]

# Print cubed values of remaining elements
for value in remaining:
    cubed_value = value ** 3
    print(cubed_value)
